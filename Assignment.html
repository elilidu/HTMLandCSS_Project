				In 1925, a ravaging case of diphtheria broke out in the isolated Alaskan village of Nome. No plane or ship 
				could get the serum there, so the decision was made for multiple sled dog teams to relay
				the medicine across the treacherous frozen land. The dog that often gets
				credit for eventually saving the town is Balto, but he just happened to
				run the last, 55-mile leg in the race. The sled dog who did the lion's
				share of the work was Togo. His journey, fraught with white-out storms, 
				was the longest by 200 miles and included a traverse across perilous 
				Norton Sound â€” where he saved his team and driver in a courageous
				swim through ice floes. Togo, we salute you.
